> Ucard allows you to create your own Unique Digital Business Card that you can share with others by tapping your phone or scanning a code. Ucard matches Cards with similar attributes together as suggested Cards.
> 
> Ever been to an event and wanted to exchange cards with peers? Ever got bored of carrying multiple plastic/paper cards? Ever thought about Mother Earth? 
Then Ucard is for you!

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to create custom personal cards.
- As a user, I want to edit my cards, so that I can update my info.
- As a user, I want to create different category cards (personal / business / gaming), so that I can own multiple cards.
- As a user, I want to share my card with others (NFC / QRCode), so that we can exchange info.
- As a user, I want to get matched with others, so I can find people with similar interests.
- As a user, I want to receive notifications, so that I stay upto date.

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

<img id="tech-stack" src="./readme/title4.svg"/>

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Ucard app uses:

- This project uses [React Native EXPO](https://expo.dev/) for the Frontend. Expo is a bundle of tools created around React Native to help you start an app very fast. Coupled with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- This project uses [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) for the Backend. Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).
- To send push notifications, the app uses [FireBase FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) package which supports Android and iOS.
